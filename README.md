# Batch Data Pipeline Using Apache Airflow, Spark, AWS EMR and Snowflake

This project will demonstrate the use of:

✅ Airflow to orchestrate and manage the data pipeline

✅ AWS EMR for the heavy data processing

✅ Snowflake for Data Warehousing

✅ Use Airflow to create the EMR cluster, and then terminate once the processing is complete to save on cost.
